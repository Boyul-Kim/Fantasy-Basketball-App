# Fantasy Basketball App

A dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project that allows user to create a mock fantasy draft list for the upcoming NBA season. Data for this app are courtesy of https://www.balldontlie.io/ and https://www.fantasybasketballnerd.com/

Current Feature List:
* User can search a player and view: Historical Stats over the past 5 years & Projected Stats for the upcoming year
* User can view Depth Charts for each team and by each position (clicking on their names will direct them to the player's profile)
* User can add a player from their profile into their mock draft list
* User can view the projected draft rank of the top 200 players (clicking on their names will direct them to the player's profile)

Planned Features to Add:
* Mock Draft Simulator
* Data analytic funtionality for when the season actually starts
* Make the design of the app more aesthetically pleasing

What I learned from working on this projected:
* This was my first time using APIs. So learning how it worked and how to research into using different APIs was a great learning experience.
* Learning to organize your code (naming functions, variables, objects and the overall structure of your code) is very important.
* Investing time in planning out your project goes a long way when you actually start coding.
